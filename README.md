# Polyglot

As a way of keeping things fresh and exploring new languages, I started doing one [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem a day without repeating a programming language.

(It very quickly turned into "one whenever I feel like it", sometimes more than one a day, sometimes none.)

Idea shamelessly stolen from [eevee](https://github.com/eevee).

Languages used so far, in order:
* Python
* Ruby
* C
* Java
* Coffeescript
* Lolcode
* Lua
* Perl
* C++
* Haskell
* Go
* Rust
* Erlang
* Clojure
* JavaScript
* Scala
* Swift
* C#
* Elm
* Elixir
