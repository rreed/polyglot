# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), 
# a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. 
# Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position 
# in the list to obtain a name score.
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, 
# which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. 
# So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

# read the list, split it into lines on comma, then sort it
