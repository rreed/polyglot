# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, 
# then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; 
# therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

# Finds the set of all divisors of the given `num` and returns the sum of the set.
# NB that this algorithm as written considers the number itself as a divisor, as obviously a number is divisible evenly by itself.
# So if you want "proper divisors", you'll need to subtract out the number itself from the return value.
